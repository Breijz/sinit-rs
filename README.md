sinit-rs 
=======
sinit (or suckless init if you prefer) rewritten in rust for fun and maybe some testing if i get around to it.  
  
Installation
--------
Installation *should* be mostly simple:  
```  
$ cargo build --release
$ cp target/release/sinit /bin/init
```
  

License stuff:  
--------
Originial code as published by the suckless folks is licensed under the MIT/X License, likewise with this, im no legal expert,  
so only modification done was adding contributer copyright, in addition to the one already there, (which hopefully is correct,
no amount of googling helped sadly)
